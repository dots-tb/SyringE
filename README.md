#Q&A
*Why should I use this PoS?

It gives you network capabilities.


*PoC, more like PoS?

I was going to make it also a plugin manager but... I'm not that good.



*Wow! Your the best junior dev, much better than Rinnegatamante!!1 Surely you can explain how it works?

I'll sum it up with my Highschool AP CompSci knowledge: It just werks.



*Can you make an FTP plugin?

Ask Rinnegatamante or something to be honest. I just got lucky with this.



*Why should I trust you? How do I know your not Silica&Pina?

The source is available. 



Thanks to: barooney, TheFlow (for being so cryptic), Wololo, YifanLu, Rinnegatamante, and everyone else in this great scene. 

RIP Major_Tom :'(
